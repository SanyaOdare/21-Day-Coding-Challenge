Challenge #10 - Flying solo
After solving the last task, you feel grateful to Larry for his help 
but also a growing sense of confidence in your own abilities. 
While a significant portion of programming is about problem-solving on your own, 
learning how to gather the individual resources to find a solution is equally important.

Like this next task, for example. Your supervisor has assigned you to write a function 
that calculates the average wind speed given the data generated by your previous work.

After pondering the task for a while, you come to the conclusion that the problem 
at hand requires you to work with the weather objects that you made a few challenges ago.

Instructions
(This challenge is worth 5 points)

Your task is to create a function that will take in an array of weather objects and will return a rounded average of the wind speed.

Since we work with an unknown amount of entries, you will need to calculate the average wind speed using loops.

Examples
Input:

    const exampleEntries = [
      { 
        temperature:0, 
        weather:"sunny", 
        windDirection: "NNE", 
        windSpeed:24
      },
      { 
        temperature:10, 
        weather:"cloudy", 
        windDirection: "NNE", 
        windSpeed:9 
      }
    ] 
    
Output:
