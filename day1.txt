Challenge #1 - To compilation and beyond!
Welcome to the Space, Propulsion, and Exploration Division at Lighthouse Labs! 
Or, SPELL for short. As a part of SPELL’s emergency operations programming team, 
it’s up to you to make magic happen by addressing critical and time-sensitive 
coding tasks with your elite programming skills.

Wait, what’s that? You wouldn’t necessarily describe your skills as “elite”? 
Well no matter, as a new hire, SPELL doesn’t expect you to know everything 
right off the bat. In fact, we have just the task for a novice programmer 
like yourself. In preparation for SPELL’s upcoming orbital spaceflight mission, 
we need to do a top-to-bottom efficacy review of our systems.

Our latest testing indicates a malfunctioning component in our communications apparatus. 
For some reason, messages from mission control are not being correctly displayed on board 
the shuttle. While the message is being displayed on the shuttle’s terminal, the sender’s 
name is not displayed beside it.

Your first task is to write a function that will take two string parameters and return 
a string containing the sender name and the message in the form specified in the instructions.

Examples
Input:

    parseMessage("Mission Control", "Hello there!")
    
Output:

    Mission Control: Hello there!
