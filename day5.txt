Challenge #5 - You get a job, she gets a job, he gets a job
After finishing the task with 20 minutes to spare, you walk back to your workspace 
from the cafeteria. Satiated but hungry to learn more about your new role at SPELL, 
you report to your supervisor and present the answer you came up with.

Elated about your confidence and problem-solving abilities, your supervisor 
enthusiastically assigns you a new task. Since you’re progressing so fast, 
pre-flight preparations have been accelerated.

Now that a crew has been selected, you need to write a new function that will assign 
a job to each astronaut. Since you’ve had some experience with updating object properties 
in some of the previous challenges, this should be fairly straightforward. 
Just keep in mind that you need to return the astronaut after updating the job property.

Examples
Input:

    const exampleAstronaut = {
      firstName:"Chris",
      lastName: "Hadfield",
      nickname:"Space Oddity",
      prefix:"Astronaut"
    }
    
Output:

    const exampleAstronaut = {
      firstName:"Chris",
      lastName: "Hadfield",
      nickname:"Space Oddity",
      prefix:"Astronaut",
      job:"Shuttle DJ"
    }
