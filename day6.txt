Challenge #6 - Another day, another challenge
Congratulating you on a job well done on the last task, your supervisor wastes 
no time in assigning you another one. This time, you’ll need to assign specific 
astronauts to a roster (list of astronauts).

Essentially, the function needs to do two things: add an astronaut to the roster 
and return the updated array. As you exit your supervisor’s office and continue 
the linoleum-lined trek to that increasingly familiar storage closet, you feel 
a mixture of dread and curiosity as you wonder who, or what awaits you behind 
that pale white door.

Create a function that takes in a roster array and an astronaut object. The function will add the astronaut to the roster and return the updated roster.

Examples
Input:

    const exampleRoster = []
    const exampleAstronaut = {
      firstName:"Chris",
      lastName: "Hadfield",
      nickname:"Space Oddity",
      prefix:"Astronaut"
    }
    
Output:

    const exampleRoster = [
      {
        firstName:"Chris",
        lastName: "Hadfield",
        nickname:"Space Oddity",
        prefix:"Astronaut"
      }
