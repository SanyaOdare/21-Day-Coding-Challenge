Challenge #8 - It’s all part of the job
Walking through the high-arched entrance of SPELL’s headquarters, 
you marvel at the opportunity you’ve been given, to impact 
and influence the success of a vast cosmic journey. Truly only a few lucky individuals 
are rewarded for their lifelong career efforts in such a gratifying manner.

Having said that, the individual tasks you're given don’t always match the scope of the overall project, despite their necessity.

Like this next task, given to you by your supervisor after a hurried conversation; 
you’re required to find the number of active astronauts within the current roster list you helped set up.

“Sometimes, even rocket science isn’t exactly rocket science,” you think to yourself.
