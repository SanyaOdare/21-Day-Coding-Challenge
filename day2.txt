Challenge #2 - One small step at a time
“Great work on the last task! That wasn’t too hard was it?” exclaims your energetic supervisor. 
“Before you get started on this next one, we need to find a place for you to work while we finish 
the on-boarding process. As we’re busy with pre-launch preparations, we haven’t had time to set up 
a desk for you. Why don’t you try using the old storage closet down the hall?”

Upon opening the paper thin door to the storage closet, you’re greeted by a claustrophobic scene; 
a small office space, now used to store boxes of previous mission logs and all manner of repurposed junk. 
Filled to the brim with discarded memos, notes, and diagrams, you sift through the mountainous clutter 
to eventually reveal a pitiful desk, fortunately situated beside an electrical outlet.

You turn on your laptop, plug in your charger, and take a seat with a steely resolve 
to complete your task as fast as possible.

Registering new astronauts was handled manually in previous missions but it's taking too much time. 
Knowing that the astronaut information is already listed in a data set, you propose to optimize 
that job with programming.

Your task is to automate that process by creating a function that will take in an astronaut object 
as a parameter and return a string using the properties of the astronaut.

Examples
Input:

    const exampleAstronaut = {
      firstName: "Yuri",
      lastName: "Gagarin",
      nickname: "First!",
      prefix: "Cosmonaut"
    }
    
Output:

    Cosmonaut: Yuri "First!" Gagarin
    
Input:

    const exampleAstronaut = {
      firstName: "Neil",
      lastName: "Armstrong",
      nickname: "Steps",
      prefix: "Astronaut"
    }
    
Output:

    Astronaut: Neil "Steps" Armstrong
